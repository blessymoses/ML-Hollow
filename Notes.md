## ML Trivia
- Capturing patterns from data is called `fitting` or `training` the model.
- The data used to fit the model is called the `training data`.
- column we want to predict is called the `prediction target`.
- The columns that are inputted into our model (and later used to make predictions) are called `features`.
- The steps to building and using a model are:
  - `Define`: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
  - `Fit`: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
  - `Predict`: Just what it sounds like
  - `Evaluate`: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
-  `Overfitting` - a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data.
- When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called `underfitting`.
- Decision Tree
  - A tree's `depth` is a measure of how many splits it makes before coming to a prediction.
